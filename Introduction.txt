Introduction to Ethernet Switching
Ethernet, as a communication protocol, operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model and Layer 1 of the TCP/IP model.
While we will be discussing Ethernet switch operation using the OSI model as our reference, it is important to understand where the Ethernet protocol operates within the universally approved Internet/Network communication suite, which is TCP/IP.

Before Ethernet Switches: Hubs and Bridges
Before the evolution of switches, hubs and bridges were used to connect network segments.

What are Hubs?
Hubs were created to enable the interconnection of two or more network segments. However, they were not intelligent devices and had no memory. A hub simply forwarded packets without verifying recipient information, which led to collisions, latency, and network congestion.

To address these issues, bridges were introduced into the network.

What are Bridges?
Unlike hubs, bridges were smarterâ€”they had memory and could record vital information about devices as communication flowed. This helped reduce network congestion.

Bridges operated at Layer 2 of the OSI model, while hubs functioned at Layer 1.
A bridge could store MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, which allowed it to intelligently forward packets to the correct destination instead of broadcasting them to all devices. Bridges were faster and more efficient than hubs.

However, as networks grew and more devices were deployed, bridges were no longer sufficient. The demand for smarter, more secure, and scalable network solutions led to the evolution of Ethernet switches.

What are Ethernet Switches?
Ethernet switches are Layer 2 devices capable of connecting multiple network segments, isolating traffic, and storing information about devices communicating over the network. Unlike hubs, switches intelligently filter and deliver packets only to their intended destinations, improving efficiency and reducing congestion.

Ethernet switches can also function at Layer 3. These Layer 3 switches have routing capabilities, allowing devices to communicate over remote networks rather than just within a Local Area Network (LAN).

Note: Layer 3 switches use IP addresses for routing and can also provide DHCP service in some network configurations.
